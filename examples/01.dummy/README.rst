**01.dummy**
------------

This example doesn't do anything special.  In fact it does nothing :)

The file ``01.dummy/Makefile`` (called also a **makbet's** scenario file)
contains list of all tasks which are specific for this example.  All tasks
defined in this example are fake tasks (please check the content of
``examples/01.dummy/tasks/generic-task.sh`` script), therefore it can be
run at any time with minimal requirements and effort.
