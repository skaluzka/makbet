**Background**
--------------

Together with **makbet's** source code we are providing also some minimal test
scenarios covering basic set of **makbet's** features.

**Directory structure**
-----------------------

Please see below **makbet's** flatten tests directory structure (some files
were intentionally omitted to shrink the listing).

- ``resources/`` - This directory contains set of additional resources (files
  and directories) used during performing **makbet's** tests.

- ``resources/expected/`` - This directory contains various files prepared
  strictly for comparison purposes against results generated by **makbet**
  during the tests.

- ``resources/expected/examples/`` - This directory contains only files created
  based on examples provided with **makbet** (see the top-level ``examples/``
  directory).
