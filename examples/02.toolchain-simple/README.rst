**02.toolchain-simple**
-----------------------

The main goal of this example is to build (locally from the source code)
a simple so-called toolchain consists of the following tools:

- **doxygen 1.8.20**
- **git 2.29.2**
- **kcov 38**
- **make 4.3**
- **python 3.9.0**


The ``Makefile`` file in current directory contains all tasks needed to
download the source code of above tools as well as build them locally
from freshly downloaded shources.
