**01.dummy**
------------

This example doesn't do anything special.  In fact it does nothing :)

The ``Makefile`` file (called also a **makbet's** scenario file)
contains list of all tasks which are required in this example.  All defined
tasks are fake tasks (please check the content of ``./tasks/generic-task``
script), therefore this example can be run at any time with minimal
requirements and effort.
