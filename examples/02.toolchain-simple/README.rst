**02.toolchain-simple**
-----------------------

The main goal of this example is to build (locally from the source code)
a simple toolchain consists of the following tools:

- **doxygen 1.8.20**
- **git 2.29.2**
- **kcov 38**
- **make 4.3**
- **python 3.9.1**


The ``Makefile`` file in current directory contains all tasks needed
for downloading the sources and building every tool listed above.
