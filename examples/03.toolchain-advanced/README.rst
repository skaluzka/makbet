**03.toolchain-advanced**
-------------------------

The aim of this example is the same as in ``examples/02.toolchain-simple``
case.  In fact, the real differences between **02.toolchain-simple** and
**03.toolchain-advanced** examples are the ``Makefile`` files which both have
different constructions.  **03.toolchain-advanced** example uses more advanced
syntax in its ``Makefile`` file.  However, both examples share the same set
of tasks from ``examples/lib/tasks/build-scripts/`` directory.  Two different
versions of the same scenario have been created for comparison and testing
purposes.  As expected final results for both **02.toolchain-simple** and
**03.toolchain-advanced** should be the same.
